# Code a data base query optimizer in C++

### Promt 1

Creating a database query optimizer in C++ is a complex task that involves understanding database internals, query parsing, optimization techniques, and execution plans. Below is a simplified example to give you a starting point. This example will focus on parsing a basic SQL SELECT query and applying a simple optimization technique (e.g., reordering joins based on a heuristic).

#### Explanation  
Define the Query Structure: We define a simple structure to represent the SQL query.
Parse the Query: We create a placeholder function to parse the SQL query string into our Query structure.
Optimize the Query: We implement a simple heuristic to reorder the tables based on the number of rows.
Generate the Optimized Query: We generate the SQL string from the optimized query structure.
Main Function: We put everything together and demonstrate the optimization process.
This is a very basic example and real-world query optimizers are much more complex, involving cost-based optimization, various join algorithms, and more sophisticated parsing and execution planning.

### Prompt 2  

Show me a complete example with all the segments assembled properly with their associated file names and directory structure. 

Sure, I'll provide a complete example with all the segments assembled properly. We'll organize the code into a single file for simplicity, but in a real-world scenario, you might want to split it into multiple files for better organization.

### Prompt 3  

Show me an example of a real and complex algorthim in the context of this query optimizer to compare and contrast them.

Sure, let's delve into a more complex algorithm for query optimization. We'll implement a cost-based optimizer that uses dynamic programming to find the optimal join order. This is a simplified version of the dynamic programming approach used in the System R optimizer.

#### Explanation  

Define the Query Structure: We define a simple structure to represent the SQL query.
Parse the Query: We create a placeholder function to parse the SQL query string into our Query structure.
Cost-based Optimization: We implement a dynamic programming approach to find the optimal join order based on estimated join costs.
Generate the Optimized Query: We generate the SQL string from the optimized query plan.
Main Function: We put everything together and demonstrate the optimization process. 

#### Comparison  
Simple Heuristic Optimizer:

Uses a basic heuristic to reorder tables based on the number of rows.
Simple and fast but may not always produce the optimal join order.

Cost-based Optimizer:

Uses dynamic programming to find the optimal join order based on estimated join costs.
More complex and computationally intensive but can produce better query plans.
This example demonstrates how a more sophisticated algorithm can improve query optimization by considering the cost of different join orders.

#### Prompt 4  

Show me in context of this same example with the real implementation of the actual query parsing logic needed to parse the SQL string.

To provide a complete example with actual query parsing logic, we'll use a simple SQL parser to convert the SQL string into our Query structure. This will involve tokenizing the SQL string and extracting the relevant parts (SELECT columns, FROM tables, and JOIN conditions).
